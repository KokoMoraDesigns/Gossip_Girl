                    Hi my loves,</p><p>Did you missed me?</p><p>The adrenaline of not knowing when were you being watched?</p> 
                    <p>The euphoria of being the watchers?</p> <p>The perturbing churning of emotions when reading in my body your own story?</p> 
                    
                    <p>Well, that's a shame, because... hi bitches! I'm back! </p> 
                    <p>Back in 2007, Mother was the 
                    -slightly disturbed- diary of a man who contemplated from the periphery the world he so badly wanted to be a part of 
                    -a man who years later would evolve into an actual psychopath-. Years later, in 2021, Gossip Girl 2.0, was 
                    created by a tiny, rancorous & revenger group of teachers who wanted to feel some power in an elitist school... </p>
                    <p> And you may be wondering: who is GG here for? Well... Duh... for <b>the baddies!</b> For all those amazing 
                    sinners who live a wild, free, self-loving and non-apologetic life, but returns to school every Monday just to see the two-faced gossips who sin in secret and criticize under the spotlight.
                    We hate hypocrisy in my family, so let's do something about it, shall we? And by something I mean airing all your dirty little secrets, 
                    so that next time you want to whisper about someone else, you just encounter a shocked face claiming 'for real? Are you really trying to go down there?'.</p><p>
                    I know, I know... you hate me, you despise me, you want me to disappear, blah, blah, blah. But that's not gonna happen, and, in fact, 
                    maybe that's just your fear screaming, because I really think you're slightly excited to meet me, so take a moment and make both of us a favor: 
                    breath in for 4 seconds... now hold you breath for 7 seconds... and breath out for another 8 seconds. Hope you are feeling better now.</p><p className='edit-paragraph'> Didn't you 
                    wanted to be the main character of your life? Welcome to the movie... </p>
