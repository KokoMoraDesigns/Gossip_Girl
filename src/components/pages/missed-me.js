                <p className='edit-paragraph'>Hi my loves,</p><p>Did you missed me?</p><p>The adrenaline of not knowing when were you being watched?</p> 
                    <p>The euphoria of being the watchers?</p> <p>The shock of reading your own story in my body?</p> 
                    The joy and the surprise of discovering your friends' secrets?<p>
                    Well, that's a shame... I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm a little sad about your feelings towards me.</p><p>
                    However, I don't need your sympathy in order to exist. You've been so naughty people that the accumulation 
                    of all your karma has summoned me, so... hi bitches! I'm back! Back in 2007, Mother, Gossip Girl OG, was the 
                    -slightly disturbed- diary of a man who contemplated from the periphery the world he so badly wanted to be a part of 
                    -a man who years later would evolve into an actual psychopath-. Years later, in 2021, her Daughter, Gossip Girl 2.0, was 
                    created by a tiny, rancorous & revenger group of teachers who wanted to feel some power in an elitist school. Am I being 
                    nostalgic about my family? No, not at all, I am just saying the cosmos has decided that it's time for the magic to manifest 
                    itself a third time, so she gave birth to a little sister for beautiful Gossip Girl 2.0: hi, I'm the problem, it's me!</p><p>
                    I want us to be friends, so you can call me by my initials: GG.</p><p> And you may be wondering: if her mother helped a troubled 
                    writer and her sister a bitter group of teachers... who is GG here for? Well... Duh! I am here for the baddies. For all those amazing 
                    sinners who live a wild, free, self-loving and non-apologetic life, but have to return every Monday to school just to hear the malicious 
                    whispers about them and to see the whisperers' two-faced faces, who sin in the darkness and criticize under the spotlight.</p><p>
                    Well... in my family we hate hypocrisy. So let's do something about it, shall we? And by something I mean airing all your dirty little secrets, 
                    so that next time you want to whisper about someone, you just encounter a shocked face claiming 'for real? Are you really trying to go down there?'.</p><p>
                    I know, I know... you are angry at me, you hate me, you despise me, you want me to disappear, blah, blah, blah. But that's not gonna happen, and, in fact, 
                    that's just your fear screaming, not your real feelings -I really think you're slightly excited to meet me-, so take a moment and make both of us a favor: 
                    breath in for 4 seconds... now hold you breath for 7 seconds... and breath out for another 8 seconds. Hope you are feeling better now.</p><p> Also, in case you are
                    still angry, before you give in to the urge to insult me, think about it this way: by the moment in which we say goodbye to each other and I go to sleep with 
                    my mom and older sister... you will be a baddie too! Isn't it much more fun to be a free sinner than a fearful carper? How was it? I can't recall... Oh, yeah: 
                    'good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere'. So let's all sin under the spotlight together! I can promise you: you will be much happier.</p><p className='edit-paragraph'> Didn't you 
                    wanted to be the main character of your life? Welcome to the movie... </p>
